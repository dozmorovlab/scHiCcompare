Description: This package provides functions for differential chromatin 
    interaction analysis between two single-cell Hi-C data groups. It includes
    tools for imputation, normalization, and differential analysis of chromatin
    interactions. The package implements pooling techniques for imputation and 
    offers methods to normalize and test for differential interactions across 
    single-cell Hi-C datasets.
